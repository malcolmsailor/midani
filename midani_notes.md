# Features from the original script that I have left unimplemented in the re-factored version

- Multiple "rectangles" per note
- Color ranges
- Colors are randomized (and with possibility of "freezing" them)
- settings:
    - shadow_highlight_weaken_factor: float = 1

# TODO

- colors should have transparency as well
